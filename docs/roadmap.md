# Notez Development Roadmap

This document outlines planned features for Notez beyond the current MVP implementation.

Last Updated: 2026-02-27

---

## Current Status: v1.8.0

Public-readiness release: PII scrub, security defaults hardened, governance files (LICENSE, SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md), documentation rewrite.

---

## Phase 1: Stability & Security ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE

> **Goal:** Prepare for public release with security hardening and testing foundation

### 1.1 Security Hardening ✅ COMPLETE

- [x] Rate limiting via `@fastify/rate-limit`
  - Login endpoint: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
  - API endpoints: 100 requests per minute
  - Password reset: 3 attempts per 15 minutes
- [x] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [x] Image content validation (Sharp-based)
- [x] Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`)
- [x] Session invalidation on logout
- [x] Brute force protection (IP + username keying)
- [x] Production environment validation

### 1.2 Remaining 1.0 Tasks

**Status:** In Progress
**Tracking:** See issues labeled `1.0-hardening`

- [x] Error boundary coverage (#69) — Fixed in v1.4.0
- [ ] Load testing with concurrent users (#67)
- [ ] Memory leak detection (#68)
- [ ] Edge case input testing (#70)
- [ ] Authentication edge cases (#64)
- [ ] Avatar loading after logout/login (#74)

---

## Next Up: User-Reported Bugs (v1.4.1) ✅ COMPLETE

> **Goal:** Fix bugs reported by real users via in-app feedback
> **Source:** In-app feedback submissions from user "pam"

### Shared Note Metadata Not Saving + Stale Folder List ✅

**Fixed in v1.4.1** — Auto-save now allows metadata (folder, title, tags) saves via REST even in collaborative mode. Backend returns 403 for permission errors. FolderChip already refreshes on open (was already implemented).

### Kanban Board Ignores Completed Tasks Filter ✅

**Fixed in v1.4.1** — Added "Show completed" toggle to KanbanBoard header. Hides COMPLETED and CANCELLED columns when unchecked (default: unchecked). Keyboard navigation respects visible columns.

### Modal Text Selection Closes Dialog ✅

**Fixed in v1.4.1** — Switched backdrop from `onClick` to `onMouseDown` in ShareDialog, ConfirmDialog, and WhatsNewModal (already fixed in FeedbackModal since v1.3.3).

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced Note Capabilities

> **Goal:** Add features that enhance daily note-taking workflow

### 2.1 MCP Server Integration ✅ COMPLETE (v1.6.0)

- [x] API token system (`ntez_` prefix, SHA-256 hashed, scoped read/write)
- [x] Token management routes (POST/GET/DELETE /api/tokens)
- [x] MCP API routes (/api/mcp/* — notes, tasks, folders)
- [x] Standalone MCP server package (`notez-mcp/`) with 11 tools
- [x] Notes: search, get, get-by-title, create, append, list-recent
- [x] Tasks: list, get, create, update-status
- [x] Folders: list
- [x] Token management UI in frontend Settings page (v1.7.0)
- [x] npm-publishable notez-mcp — `npx notez-mcp` (v1.7.0)
- [ ] Semantic search tool (requires pgvector — see Phase 3.2)

### 2.2 Note Linking (Wiki-Style)

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** High
**Issue:** #88

Enable `[[Note Title]]` syntax to link between notes:
- TipTap extension for `[[]]` syntax
- Autocomplete for note titles

### 2.3 Version History

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium
**Issue:** #89

Track note changes and enable restore:
- Capture snapshots on significant saves
- Keep last 10 versions per note
- Simple diff view
- One-click restore

### 2.4 Code Block Enhancements

**Status:** Partially Complete
**Priority:** Medium

- [x] Click-to-copy button on code blocks (v1.16.0)
- [ ] Syntax highlighting with language detection (lowlight / highlight.js integration)

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium

AI-powered semantic search:
- Generate embeddings for note content
- Store in pgvector
- Hybrid search: full-text + semantic
- "Find similar notes" feature

### 3.3 Import/Export

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Medium

Bulk data management:
- Export all notes as markdown (zip)
- Export to JSON for backup
- Import from markdown files
- Import from Obsidian/Notion format

### 3.4 API Documentation

**Status:** Planned
**Priority:** Low

- OpenAPI/Swagger specification
- Interactive documentation UI

---

## Phase 4: Collaboration & Mobile
